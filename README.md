## Touch-Carousel

This Carousel is an OOP one (with Js Classes). I applied a "Play/Pause" logic to it, and make it "fully featured" for mouse, keyboard, and touch screens. It's fully responsive too.

Technologies and Concepts: lot of ES7+ JavaScript, POO, Navigation Logic, Touch Events, DOM, Scss and Parcel.
